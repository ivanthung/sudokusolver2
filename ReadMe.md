# SUDOKU SOLVER 2

This is my Second Sudoku Solver project.
The first one was a functional but naive recursion programme that cycled through all numbers from the top left to the bottom right.

## Structure and plan

### Path Seeking Modules
1. Implement module that that inputs Sudoku matrix and outputs a possible paths to the matrix. These paths can be grouped by, among others:
- a row-first filling strategies.
- column first filing strategies.
- square filling strategies.

### Testing Modules
1. Implement a testing module that counts the amount of iterations and the time spent for path.
2. Estimate the sensitivity of each path towards which number is tried first for each individual cell.
3. Compare performance of strategies according to Sudoku rank.

### Data comparison and visualisation modules
1. A sudoku animation.
2. Comparisons of sudoko's on graphs and others.

# Data input method.
1. Add a database of Sudoku files according to rank.

## Background
Learning goals:
- How to to find solving pathways.
- How to evaluate different options in an efficient way.
